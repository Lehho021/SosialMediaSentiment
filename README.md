## Business Problem
Companies face challenges in optimizing their social media content strategy across multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter). Businesses need to understand:

* Engagement Effectiveness - How content performs across different social media platforms
* User Sentiment - How the audience feels about the content being shared
* Platform Strategy - Does a different approach need to be taken for each platform
* Time Optimization - When is the best time to post content
* Content Recommendations - What type of content gets the highest engagement

## Key Performance Indicators (KPI)

This analysis measures several key KPIs to evaluate the effectiveness of a social media strategy:

### Engagement Metrics
* Number of likes per platform
* Number of retweets/shares per platform
* Number of comments per platform
*Total engagement rate (likes + retweets + comments / number of posts)

### Sentiment Metrics
* Sentiment distribution (Positive, Negative, Neutral) per platform
* Change in sentiment over time
* Correlation between sentiment and engagement

### Temporal Metrics
* Engagement by posting time (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
* Monthly and yearly engagement trends
* Seasonal engagement

### Content Performance
* Top performing content per platform
* Hashtag performance
* Content type engagement

## Visualization

The “This Month” panel shows monthly engagement trends with peaks at the beginning of the month and mid-month (days 7-8), while the “This Year” panel shows significant year-on-year engagement growth with a dramatic spike in 2023-2024. The “Comments By Post” section below shows engagement per specific content on each platform, with different posts achieving the highest engagement: “A playful escapade in the…” (Facebook), “Embraced by the hopeful…” (Instagram), and “Proudly scaling the peaks…” (Twitter), all achieving a score of 3. The dashboard features filters for hashtags, likes (1-80), retweets (1-40), timestamps (morning/afternoon/evening/night), and date ranges, months, and years, allowing for detailed analysis of a company’s social media performance.
